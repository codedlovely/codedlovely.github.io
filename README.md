This is my personal portfolio I'm working on.

I know this website still looks broken in layout when it is opened on tablet/small display. I'm trying to adjust style for them.
Other than that, I truly enjoy coding a website. So I want to share my passion for coding and fun with other coders/web developers.

ThanksðŸ––
